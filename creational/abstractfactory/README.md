# Abstract Factory Pattern

## Intent
Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

## Problem Solved
When you need to create families of related objects and ensure they're used together, while keeping the creation logic separate from the business logic.

## Go Implementation

```go
// Abstract product interfaces
type Door interface {
    GetDescription() string
}

type DoorFittingExpert interface {
    GetDescription() string
}

// Abstract factory interface
type DoorFactory interface {
    MakeDoor() Door
    MakeFittingExpert() DoorFittingExpert
}

// Concrete factory
type WoodenDoorFactory struct{}

func (w WoodenDoorFactory) MakeDoor() Door {
    return WoodenDoor{}
}

func (w WoodenDoorFactory) MakeFittingExpert() DoorFittingExpert {
    return Carpenter{}
}
```

## Key Features

1. **Family Creation**: Creates families of related objects
2. **Consistency**: Ensures objects in a family work together
3. **Isolation**: Isolates concrete classes from client code

## Benefits

- **Consistency**: Products from the same family are guaranteed to work together
- **Isolation**: Client code is isolated from concrete classes
- **Easy Substitution**: Entire product families can be easily changed

## When to Use

- When the system should be independent of how its products are created
- When you want to provide a library of products that work together
- When you need to enforce constraints about which products work together

## Real-world Examples

- **GUI Frameworks**: Creating consistent UI elements (Windows, macOS, Linux themes)
- **Database Drivers**: Creating related database objects (connections, commands, transactions)
- **Game Development**: Creating themed game elements (medieval, futuristic, fantasy)
- **Document Processing**: Creating related document elements (headers, paragraphs, tables)

## Go-Specific Notes

- Go interfaces make it easy to define abstract product contracts
- Struct composition works well for implementing product families
- Go's implicit interface satisfaction provides flexibility
- Factory functions can return interfaces for maximum abstraction
