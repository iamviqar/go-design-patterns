# Factory Method Pattern

## Real World Example
üè≠ Consider the case of a hiring manager. It is impossible for one person to interview for each of the positions. Based on the job opening, she has to decide and delegate the interview steps to different people.

## In Plain Words
It provides a way to delegate the instantiation logic to child classes.

## Wikipedia Definition
In class-based programming, the factory method pattern is a creational pattern that uses factory methods to deal with the problem of creating objects without having to specify the exact class of the object that will be created. This is done by creating objects by calling a factory method‚Äîeither specified in an interface and implemented by child classes, or implemented in a base class and optionally overridden by derived classes‚Äîrather than by calling a constructor.

## Intent
Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

## Problem Solved
Useful when there is some generic processing in a class but the required sub-class is dynamically decided at runtime. Or putting it in other words, when the client doesn't know what exact sub-class it might need.

## Go Implementation

```go
// Product interface
type Interviewer interface {
    AskQuestions() string
}

// Creator interface with factory method
type HiringManager interface {
    MakeInterviewer() Interviewer
    TakeInterview() string
}

// Concrete creators implement the factory method
type DevelopmentManager struct{}

func (d DevelopmentManager) MakeInterviewer() Interviewer {
    return Developer{}
}
```

## Key Features

1. **Delegation**: Object creation is delegated to subclasses
2. **Flexibility**: Easy to add new product types
3. **Encapsulation**: Creation logic is encapsulated in specific managers

## Benefits

- **Open/Closed Principle**: Open for extension, closed for modification
- **Single Responsibility**: Each creator has one reason to change
- **Loose Coupling**: Client code works with abstractions

## When to Use

- When a class can't anticipate the class of objects it needs to create
- When a class wants its subclasses to specify the objects it creates
- When you want to localize the knowledge of which class gets created

## Real-world Examples

- **UI Framework**: Different platforms create different UI controls
- **Database Drivers**: Different databases create different connection objects
- **Payment Processing**: Different providers create different payment processors
- **File Parsers**: Different parsers for different file formats

## Go-Specific Notes

- Go's composition over inheritance works well with factory methods
- Interface satisfaction is implicit, making implementations flexible
- Go's struct embedding can simulate inheritance for shared behavior
- Error handling can be incorporated into factory method returns
