# State Pattern

## Real World Example
ðŸ“± Imagine you are using some drawing application, you choose the paint brush to draw. Now the brush changes its behavior based on the selected color i.e. if you have chosen red color it will draw in red, if blue then it will draw in blue etc.

## In Plain Words
It lets you change the behavior of a class when the state changes.

## Wikipedia Definition
The state pattern is a behavioral software design pattern that implements a state machine in an object-oriented way. With the state pattern, a state machine is implemented by implementing each individual state as a derived class of the state pattern interface, and implementing state transitions by invoking methods defined by the pattern's superclass.

## Intent
Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.

## Problem Solved
When an object's behavior depends on its state and it must change its behavior at runtime depending on that state.

## Go Implementation

```go
// State interface
type WritingState interface {
    Write(words string) string
}

// Concrete states
type UpperCase struct{}

func (u UpperCase) Write(words string) string {
    return strings.ToUpper(words)
}

type LowerCase struct{}

func (l LowerCase) Write(words string) string {
    return strings.ToLower(words)
}

// Context
type TextEditor struct {
    state WritingState
}

func (te *TextEditor) SetState(state WritingState) {
    te.state = state
}

func (te *TextEditor) Type(words string) string {
    return te.state.Write(words)
}
```

## Key Features

1. **State-dependent Behavior**: Behavior changes based on internal state
2. **State Encapsulation**: Each state encapsulates its behavior
3. **Runtime State Changes**: States can be changed at runtime

## Benefits

- **Eliminates Conditionals**: Removes large conditional statements
- **Clean State Transitions**: Makes state transitions explicit
- **Easy to Extend**: New states can be added easily
- **State-specific Behavior**: Each state handles its own behavior

## When to Use

- When an object's behavior depends on its state
- When you have many conditional statements based on object state
- When state transitions are complex
- When you want to make state transitions explicit

## Real-world Examples

- **State Machines**: Traffic lights, vending machines
- **Game Development**: Character states (idle, running, jumping)
- **UI Components**: Button states (normal, pressed, disabled)
- **Connection States**: Network connection states

## Go-Specific Notes

- Go's interfaces make state pattern implementation clean
- Go's composition works well with state pattern
- State can be implemented using function types for simple cases
- Go's type system ensures state contracts are met
- Context can be passed through states for additional data
