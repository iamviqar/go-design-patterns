# Command Pattern

## Real World Example
ðŸ‘® A generic example would be you ordering food at a restaurant. You (i.e. `Client`) ask the waiter (i.e. `Invoker`) to bring some food (i.e. `Command`) and waiter simply forwards the request to Chef (i.e. `Receiver`) who has the knowledge of what and how to cook.

Another example would be you (i.e. `Client`) switching on (i.e. `Command`) the television (i.e. `Receiver`) using a remote control (`Invoker`).

## In Plain Words
Allows you to encapsulate actions in objects. The key idea behind this pattern is to provide the means to decouple client from receiver.

## Wikipedia Definition
In object-oriented programming, the command pattern is a behavioral design pattern in which an object is used to encapsulate all information needed to perform an action or trigger an event at a later time. This information includes the method name, the object that owns the method and values for the method parameters.

## Intent
Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.

## Problem Solved
When you want to decouple the object that invokes the operation from the object that performs it, and when you need to support undo operations, logging, or queueing.

## Additional Uses
Command pattern can also be used to implement a transaction based system. Where you keep maintaining the history of commands as soon as you execute them. If the final command is successfully executed, all good otherwise just iterate through the history and keep executing the `undo` on all the executed commands.

## Go Implementation

```go
// Command interface
type Command interface {
    Execute() string
    Undo() string
}

// Receiver
type Bulb struct {
    isOn bool
}

func (b *Bulb) TurnOn() string {
    b.isOn = true
    return "Bulb has been lit"
}

// Concrete command
type TurnOnCommand struct {
    bulb *Bulb
}

func (t TurnOnCommand) Execute() string {
    return t.bulb.TurnOn()
}

func (t TurnOnCommand) Undo() string {
    return t.bulb.TurnOff()
}

// Invoker
type RemoteControl struct{}

func (r RemoteControl) Submit(command Command) string {
    return command.Execute()
}
```

## Key Features

1. **Encapsulation**: Encapsulates requests as objects
2. **Decoupling**: Decouples invoker from receiver
3. **Undo Support**: Can implement undo operations
4. **Queuing**: Commands can be queued and executed later

## Benefits

- **Decoupling**: Invoker and receiver are decoupled
- **Undo/Redo**: Easy to implement undo and redo operations
- **Logging**: Commands can be logged for audit trails
- **Macro Commands**: Can combine multiple commands
- **Queuing**: Commands can be queued and executed later

## When to Use

- When you want to parameterize objects by an action to perform
- When you want to queue operations, schedule their execution, or execute them remotely
- When you want to support undo operations
- When you want to log changes so they can be reapplied after a system crash

## Real-world Examples

- **Text Editors**: Undo/redo operations
- **GUI Applications**: Button clicks, menu selections
- **Database Operations**: Transaction logs
- **Task Scheduling**: Job queues and schedulers

## Go-Specific Notes

- Go's interfaces make command pattern implementation clean
- Function types can be used for simple commands
- Go's goroutines work well with command queuing
- Context can be passed through commands for cancellation
- Error handling can be naturally integrated into command execution
