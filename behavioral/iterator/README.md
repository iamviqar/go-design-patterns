# Iterator Pattern

## Real World Example
âž¿ An old radio set will be a good example of iterator, where user could start at some channel and then use next or previous buttons to go through the respective channels. Or take an example of MP3 player or a TV set where you could press the next and previous buttons to go through the consecutive channels or in other words they all provide an interface to iterate through the respective channels, songs or radio stations.

## In Plain Words
It presents a way to access the elements of an object without exposing the underlying presentation.

## Wikipedia Definition
In object-oriented programming, the iterator pattern is a design pattern in which an iterator is used to traverse a container and access the container's elements. The iterator pattern decouples algorithms from containers; in some cases, algorithms are necessarily container-specific and thus cannot be decoupled.

## Intent
Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

## Problem Solved
When you need to traverse a collection without exposing its internal structure or when you want to support multiple traversals of collections.

## Go Implementation

```go
// Iterator interface
type Iterator interface {
    HasNext() bool
    Next() interface{}
}

// Collection
type StationList struct {
    stations []RadioStation
}

func (sl *StationList) GetIterator() Iterator {
    return &StationListIterator{
        stations: sl.stations,
        index:    0,
    }
}

// Concrete iterator
type StationListIterator struct {
    stations []RadioStation
    index    int
}

func (sli *StationListIterator) HasNext() bool {
    return sli.index < len(sli.stations)
}

func (sli *StationListIterator) Next() interface{} {
    if sli.HasNext() {
        station := sli.stations[sli.index]
        sli.index++
        return station
    }
    return nil
}
```

## Key Features

1. **Sequential Access**: Provides sequential access to collection elements
2. **Encapsulation**: Hides the internal structure of the collection
3. **Multiple Iterators**: Supports multiple simultaneous iterations

## Benefits

- **Uniform Interface**: Provides uniform way to traverse different collections
- **Encapsulation**: Internal structure of collection is hidden
- **Multiple Iterations**: Multiple iterators can traverse the same collection
- **Flexibility**: Different traversal algorithms can be implemented

## When to Use

- When you need to access a collection's elements without exposing its internal structure
- When you want to support multiple traversals of the same collection
- When you want to provide a uniform interface for traversing different collections
- When you need to support different traversal algorithms

## Real-world Examples

- **Database Cursors**: Iterating through query results
- **File Systems**: Traversing directory structures
- **Data Structures**: Iterating through lists, trees, graphs
- **Stream Processing**: Processing data streams element by element

## Go-Specific Notes

- Go's range keyword provides built-in iteration for slices, maps, and channels
- Custom iterators are useful for complex data structures
- Go's interfaces make iterator implementation straightforward
- Channels can be used to implement iterator-like patterns
- Go's for-range loop is the idiomatic way to iterate in most cases
